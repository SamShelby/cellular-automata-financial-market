## Introduction
This work presents a cellular automata model that mimics the dynamics of a market exchange from which price fluctuations can be explained. Stock markets are complex systems and in empirical sciences, they can be model as the interactions of homogeneous agents. The impact of microlevel agents behaviors causes a macrolevel system output (price fluctuation) that can be analyzed. The purpose of this work is to generate artificial financial time series that exhibit the same styled facts that we observed in real financial instruments.

### Installation

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To run the simulations go to: src/stockmarket/sim 
and run
```sh
   python sim.py
   ```
the simulation results are saved 'results' and the time series plot is saved in 'images'
